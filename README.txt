Superpowered Audio SDKWhat is it?-----------The Superpowered Audio SDK is a software development kit based on Superpowered Inc’s digital signal processing (DSP) technology. Superpowered technology allows developers to build computationally intensive audio apps and embedded applications that process more quickly and use less power than other comparable solutions. Superpowered DSP is designed and optimized, from scratch, to run on low-power mobile processors. Specifically, any device running ARM with the NEON extension (which covers 99% of all mobile devices manufactured as of Spring 2014). The current version of Superpowered Audio SDK is only for iOS. The SDK for Android will be released Summer 2014. Folders-------SuperpoweredExample (START HERE!)This example project contains everything you need to understand Superpowered.SuperpoweredCrossExampleA fully-functional DJ app project example.SuperpoweredThe SDK itself (static library and headers).
